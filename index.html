        <h2>Abstract </h2>
        <p>The purpose of the project is to bring leave data to one central place. 
        In current system, leaves count of a faculty is stored in Excel file, their 
        per-day leave is marked in a physical sheet, calculation for total attendance for a 
        month is also done on paper, and application to get a leave is sent via mail.

        The current system has data spread across various places, but with today's technology
        and in-house expertise this problem can be solved. 

        We propose an online leave centralization system where faculties can send application,
        and management can approve it, and account for it.

        This system streamlines the leave management process.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> The system has completed its first phase: design and prototyping.
        With design down, the system can now move to final development phase.
        There are many nuances yet to be thought over but the overall problem and 
        solution is now concrete.</p>

                <li>Government holidays could be fetched from a calendar API 
                    and leaves like Optional leave can be taken care in automated
